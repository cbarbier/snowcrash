# Once we understood the perl code and found out that
# even if we found the password ask on port 4646, it wont
# give us the flag. We searched for somewere else and tried
# on the backticks command executed (egrep ...). 
# Because any space would be removed and every alphabet
# will be uppercased, we couldn't access /tmp directly 
# the only place where we can create script. So we used 
# the wildcard to bypass the uppercase problem like so:
# $(/???/12/XD) which executes getflag and redirect the 
# output in a file. (both were chmod 777)
