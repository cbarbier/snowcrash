# the usage is : ./level10 file host
# A string is interested in the bin:
# %s:6969
# reading the man , google search on how to bypass access, we found 
# that we have to set up a race condition.
# create a tmp/10 directory then set the rights
# create a tmp/10/file then set the rights
# launch both while loop commands:
# > while true; do nc -lv 127.0.0.1 6969;done
# > while true; do ./level10 /tmp/prt/link 127.0.0.1; done
#
# now compile the source.c file in this directory.
# Again while that every two loop , create a symbolic link to the
# token and the /tmp/10/file (we have access to).
# watch the magic happen on the netcat loop. 
# Et voila.
