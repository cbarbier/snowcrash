# After a lot of research, there were no files owned
# by neither flag14 nor level14. No services running , we
# scanned the ports , environement.
# So we looked straight in the getflag binary located at 
# /bin/getflag with GDB.
# once we found the if forest with every uid (flag14 : 3014)
# a little jump to the correct address like :jump *0x08048de5
# the stack smashed but the flag appeared just above :).
# that's it. (this exploit could be used for every levelXX)
